      "Time Required": "34 min",
      "about": "The stroke gets its name from its sweeping arm action reminiscent of a butterfly’s wings. It is the most spectacular to watch and also the hardest to swim: this striking but also intimidating stroke seems to be beyond the capabilities of  “beginners”, but with enough practice and the right amount of power and coordination you will soon be swimming the butterfly."
